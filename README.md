## Description
In this assignment I learned about using a 3rd party API and how to incorporate that into my code. I learned about local storage and how to set and get items. I also learned about the "querySelectorAll" ability which was a big help to this project. I had myself console.log a LOT more often catching mistakes early on.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
This is a great way to keep track of todos for a typical workday. You can input whatever you would like for each hour time slot. Don't forget to save! As long as you have hit the save button corresponding with the current row you are inputting text on, your text will be saved even if you refresh the page. Happy Scheduling.

## Credits

Xpert Learning Assistant was a new tool I learned how to use. I liked how it would give me a reason why the code I was using wasn't working and how to fix it.
